## 1. Creational Patterns ##
 **Ceational design patterns** are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms.
### 1.1 Singleton
 A class of which only a single instance can exist. The **Singleton pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is named after the singleton set, which is defined to be a set containing one element. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
